#Welcome to the Hoenn Region!
#Embark on the Hoenn region from the 3DS games of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Go solo, or bring your friends with you through a multiplayer server!
#
#This map features story based on the remakes, including Team Magma or Team Aqua, as well as your rival to follow you around the region to battle and explore with.
#
#The map offers 17 cities and towns the region explore, and collect the eight gym badges of the region. Once all eight are collected, you can battle the Elite Four to become the new Pokemon League Champion.
#
#​Battle through hundreds of trainers, and speak with hundreds more NPCs to obtain XP, Pokemon, items and badges. Locations are all based on their true-game spots, so feel free to use Serebii/Bulbapedia to find something you're looking for!
#
#You can even claim your own little space in the region using Secret Bases, and call it your own!
