#Ah! Your Pokémon...
#It's clearly very friendly toward you. A Pokémon that adoring and adorable deserves a TM like this, no?
#Hmm... It's not bad, but it's also not good. You, as the Trainer, need to put in some more effort.
#It has a vicious look to it. A frightening Pokémon like that deserves a TM like this.
#If a Pokémon is very friendly toward you, Return's power is enhanced. If it's not friendly, Frustration's power goes up.
